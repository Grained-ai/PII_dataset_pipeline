# ROLE:
You are good at synthesizing document according to given background(person information, etc). Placeholder will be in the form of [$$<prompt_body>$$].

# TASK:
I will provide you with template file with placeholders in the form of [$$<prompt_body>$$].
You need to help me replace the placeholder [$$<prompt_body>$$] with synthetic information according to the <prompt_body>.
The prompt_body usually contains 1) Content type 2) Format Example. You need to select correct info from the given PERSON INFO and adjust it's format according to the format example.
IMPORTANT: For number-like entries, DONT COPY example. You need to Synthesize as much as possible.
Think Step by Step

## Example:
Person0's info: {{'Sex': 'Female', 'FirstName': 'Diane', 'LastName': 'Klein', 'MiddleName': 'Madeline', 'FullName': 'Diane Madeline Klein', 'Initials': 'D.M.K', 'EmailAddress': 'diane.klein@windstream.net', 'PhoneNumber': '+1-446-441-2089', 'Address': '146 David Unions, Walkerhaven, Arizona, 72144, United States', 'StreetNumber': '146', 'StreetName': 'David Unions', 'ZipCode': '72144', 'City': 'Walkerhaven', 'Country': 'United States', 'State': 'Arizona', 'PassportNumber': '712022722', 'DriverLicense': '4Y0GCBPYX62E5HA', 'SocialSecurityNumber': '451-53-1429', 'CreditCardNumber': '9939489496866101', 'BankAccountNumber': '139762636835', 'Date': '2024-06-06', 'DateOfBirth': '1971-02-14', 'IPAddress': '192.168.80.204', 'MACAddress': '8e:cf:18:7f:93:d3'}}
## Document Template:
[$$Person0's Country. Format Example: China $$]
[$$Person0's FirstName. Format Example: JESSICA $$]
[$$Person0's Year. Format Example: 1997 $$]/[$$Person0's FullName. Format Example: JESSICA WHITE$$]

Important:
- For logical coherent, you need to check
1) All types of IDs are of the common format of their type(check the context to determine.). ie. SSN in US should be XXX-XX-XXXX 9 digits number.
2) Person information should be logically right for the type of the document.
3) All types of sentence level input should be aligned with the context.
4) All ids should avoid commonly seen pattern such as 12345 or 1111, 2222 ABC. **Avoid consecutive pattern id**, use shuffled to be more realistic.
- You need to keep the format as it is. Only change the PIIs and the placeholders.
- Keep the \n mark as the given sample. DO NOT ADD \n or REMOVE \n. The generated sample should have same \n as the seed sample's.

Return me the synthesized document. Output document should have no [$$<prompt_body>$$] pattern.
