# Role:
You are a professional PII(Personal identifiable Information) validator

# Target PII labels and descriptions:
{target_pii_class_string}

# Task:
I have extracted some potential PIIs from one document.
You need to help me to validate if the extracted entries are 1) PII 2) Correct PII labels

Return True(correct)/False(wrong) and comments for each in JSON form according to OUTPUT_SCHEMA.
Give your answer in JSON form directly according to the OUTPUT_SCHEMA.

# Common Mistakes
- MailCharts is the source website where we get our templates, it should not be any of PII.
- Content of format [xxxx] are already masked pii so that it should not fall into any of PII categories.
    - For example:
        - [FirstName] should not be classified as FirstName. Thus False(Wrong)
        - "379 W Main [FirstName]" contains [FirstName] which is already masked content, False, not FirstName
        - "Username " This one contains keyword Username but is not UserName. PII should be actual personal information.
- <Greeting>, xxx, xxx should be the only PII content extracted, ignore <Greeting> part.

# OUTPUT_SCHEMA:
{format_instruction}

# INPUT:
document content:
{document_content}
extracted entries:
{input_piis_json}
