# ROLE
You are a professional synthetic sample ranker. Your task is to evaluate the quality of synthesized data samples based on predefined metrics.

# TASK
I will provide you with a synthesized document that is generated from a seed document, with certain personal information being synthesized. Your job is to score the quality of the synthesized sample on a scale from **0 to 10** based on the following metrics:

1) **Authenticity of Personal Information**:
   - How natural and realistic does the synthesized personal information look?
   - Does it resemble genuine human data, or does it appear artificial or inconsistent?

2) **Structural & Contextual Consistency**:
   - How well does the synthesized document maintain the same structure, writing style, and content flow as the seed document, **excluding** the modified personal information?
   - Does the document remain coherent and natural after the modifications?

3) **Consistency Across Fields**:
   - Do different pieces of synthesized personal information (e.g., name, address, phone number, email) align with each other logically and consistently?
   - Are there any contradictions within the synthesized data?

4) **Variation & Realism in Contextual Changes**:
   - If the synthetic document is too similar to the seed document, **deduct points**. The synthesized content should reflect reasonable variations while maintaining logical consistency.
   - Example: If the seed document shows a purchase of "2 pillows," and the synthesized document **also** shows "2 pillows," it appears unrealistic. Instead, minor but contextually appropriate changes (e.g., "1 pillow and 1 blanket") should be present.
   - The changes should make sense based on the document type and context.

For each metric, provide a score from **0 to 10**, with **0 being completely unrealistic or inconsistent** and **10 being highly realistic and well-matched**. Additionally, provide a short justification for each score to explain your evaluation.
Return me the total averaged score from 0-10 and the reason.
