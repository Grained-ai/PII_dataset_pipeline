{person_mapping_string}

Important:
- For logical coherent, you need to check
1) All types of IDs are of the common format of their type(check the context to determine.). ie. SSN in US should be XXX-XX-XXXX 9 digits number.
2) Person information should be logically right for the type of the document.
3) All types of sentence level input should be align with the context.
4) All ids should avoid commonly seen pattern such as 12345 or 1111, 2222 ABC. **Avoid consecutive pattern id**, use shuffled to be more realistic.
- You need to keep the format as it is. Only change the PIIs and the placeholders.

Return me 1) The refined document 2) PIIs Mapping with refined piis in JSON format.
